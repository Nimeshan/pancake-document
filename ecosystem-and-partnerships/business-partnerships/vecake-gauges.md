# ⛽ veCAKE / Gauges

For more information about veCAKE and gauges from a project's perspective, please view this PDF:

To summarize, there are two ways to incentivize liquidity on PancakeSwap as a project:

1. [Lock CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance/cake-staking) as veCAKE on BNB Chain, vote for your [desired gauges](https://pancakeswap.finance/gauges-voting)
2. Bribe on one of our [veCAKE Managers](../../products/vecake/vecake-managers.md) to influence others to vote for your [desired gauges](https://pancakeswap.finance/gauges-voting)

Both methods will result in your desired gauges / liquidity pairs receiving CAKE incentives via our [Farms](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms). The gauges first need to be whitelisted on PancakeSwap.

#### How to have a gauge whitelisted:

Step 1: Refer to the application template on our [governance forum](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/gauges-application-guidelines/46)

Step 2: Start a new topic on the forum in the [‘Gauges’ Category](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/c/gauges/) with the above-mentioned format

Step 3: Discuss with PancakeSwap community members on the details of your proposal

Step 4: The Kitchen will review and add the gauge if it is appropriate

Step 5: If a gauge is malicious or detrimental to the PancakeSwap ecosystem, the PancakeSwap Core Team can [reject / remove the gauge](broken-reference)

Step 6: Once the gauge is added, veCAKE holders can start [voting for the gauge](https://pancakeswap.finance/gauges-voting) in the same epoch

Step 7: Once the current epoch ends, and assuming the gauge receives some veCAKE votes, CAKE rewards will begin streaming to the underlying [liquidity pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms) / position manager vault starting in the next epoch
