Participating in governance voting is easy, and it is absolutely **FREE**. You don't even need to pay gas fees! Learn more about how to vote, catch the next proposal and cast your vote.

### How to vote

#### Navigate to the vote proposal

Whenever we publish a new proposal, we always attach the link to the voting page. So be sure to follow [our social channels](../../../contact-us/social-accounts-and-communities.md) for the news and updates.

Alternatively, you can visit [PancakeSwap's native voting portal](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/?\_gl=1\*pc8o0h\*\_ga\*MTUzNDEzNDQxMy4xNjAwNzkzNDM4\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNDMwMTk4Ni42MC4xLjE2MDQzMDM3MDIuMA..#/)[ ](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting)to browse the proposals in a list. If you don't see the proposal, it may be in the "soon" tab.

#### Read and pick the choice to vote

Before casting your vote, you will see a "Confirm Vote" window.

In this window, you can double-check the following items:

* The choice you picked
* Your voting power

Your voting power is equal to your veCAKE balance at the snapshot block.&#x20;

#### Check the snapshot block

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-vote-3.png)

Voting power is calculated based on a snapshot taken on the snapshot block. Therefore, purchasing or depositing more CAKE after the proposal is posted is not going to increase the voting power for that particular proposal.

If you want to know the exact time of the snapshot block. Simple click on the block number and look for the timestamp on the BscScan page.
