   2.  Link socials by selecting the connect button for each social platform. Proceed through the on-screen steps and signatures to connect your account. Please note that it may take some time for the social network services to reflect the connection. If the connection has issues the first time round, try hard refresh by entering Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R.
