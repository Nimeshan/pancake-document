# Rewards

For beta mode, quests are split into two types - **quests with rewards and without rewards**. For quests without rewards, users will complete the tasks in order to learn more about DeFi or specific products and campaigns, with no token rewards or points at the moment.&#x20;

For quests with rewards, users can earn token rewards by completing them. The rewards will be distributed via a lucky draw to all users completing the quest, as shown below.&#x20;

For example, if the total reward is 1000 USDT with 10 stipulated winners, 10 users will be drawn to receive the reward.\
