PancakeSwap Quest (Beta) is a DeFi quest platform which allows users to explore, earn and engage in DeFi products on PancakeSwap. The platform provides a gamified experience to allow both new and experienced users to interact with PancakeSwap and partner products across different chains.

### Key Features

**Build Your DeFi Profile:** Users can create and personalize their profiles, choose usernames, and create NFTs as profile pictures to showcase their DeFi identity.

**Participate**: Users can engage in tasks and challenges across PancakeSwap, including social media campaigns and on-chain adventures.

**Multi-Chain Support**: PancakeSwap Quest Beta supports eight chains: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Linea, ZKsync, Polygon zkEVM, and opBNB, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of use.

PancakeSwap is currently in beta phase, where users can participate in various tasks and campaigns. The kitchen is seeking feedback for the product from early users via Telegram and Discord.

### Quest Overview

PancakeSwap Quest (beta) will offer several different types of challenges for users, including:

* Social media follows
* Holding tokens
* Swapping for tokens

Users will perform the required tasks to complete the quests. Once completed, users will receive a token reward for certain quests or potential incentives if the quest does not currently have token rewards.

These challenges will look to incentivise users to participate in the PancakeSwap community and learn more about the different types of products at the same time. The kitchen will look to add more unique ways to engage users via other tasks in upcoming iterations. PancakeSwap Quest will be on BNB Chain, Ethereum, Zksync, Arbitrum, Base and Polygon zkEVM in beta mode.
