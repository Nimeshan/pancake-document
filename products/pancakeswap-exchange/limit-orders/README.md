# Limit Orders and Twap

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Limit Order (V2) has been deprecated and no longer in maintenance.** Please ensure you are using the latest limit order feature that supports all PancakeSwap liquidity type: [https://pancakeswap.finance/swap/limit](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap/limit)
{% endhint %}

Limit Orders allow you to get your swaps at desired prices by leaving instructions to fill buy or sell orders at specific prices. The trade will only be executed if the price on PancakeSwap reaches your limit price (or better).

TWAP (Time-weighted Average Price) is a common order type that breaks an order into smaller trade sizes and executes them at regular intervals. The main goal of a TWAP order is to reduce the order’s price impact.
