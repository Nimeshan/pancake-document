### CrossChain IFO

#### Can I sync my veCAKE for iCAKE after the IFO is LIVE?

Yes, you may veCAKE and participate any time before the IFO finishes.

However, since bridging usually takes up to 15 mins to complete, we recommend you to get prepared by bridging your iCAKE before the start of the IFO.

#### Can I participate CrossChain IFOs on BNB Chain?

No.

Crosschain IFOs are designed to bring the PancakeSwap community to a whole new multichain experience and capture all the exciting developments on blockchains besides BNB Chain.

If you need help while setting up your wallet or getting the gas tokens for a new blockchain, check out the IFO voting proposal and our social channels.

#### I have synced my veCAKE, but iCAKE didnâ€™t show up on the destination chain

We are working closely with the LayerZero team to ensure the bridging process is as seamless and fast as possible. However, due to traffic on the bridge or the destination blockchains, sometimes bridging could take up to 15 minutes to complete.

If you experience any difficulties when bridging, join our community and ask our ambassadors or admins for help.

#### Why do I have to bridge my PancakeProfile again?

To prevent cheating. Users will need to sync at least once for each new crosschain IFO. Therefore, even if you have already synced your veCAKE prior to the IFO, you will still need to perform the sync again once the IFO appears on the page.

#### What happens if I increase my veCAKE during IFO sales?

You will need to sync again to update your iCAKE on the destination chain where the IFO is being conducted.
