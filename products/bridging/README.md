With our multichain expansion and deployment on Ethereum and Aptos. CAKE is now a multichain token that is native on BNB Chain, but also available on Ethereum and Aptos.

CAKE on Ethereum or Aptos is equal to CAKE on BNB Smart Chain. They can always be bridged between these chains with a 1:1 ratio and without any fee in CAKE.

**Please note that there is only one CAKE.** There are no different versions of CAKE between different chains. And the total supply of CAKE across all blockchains will be capped at 750M, according to our v2 tokenomic litepaper.
