{% hint style="info" %}
The following guide uses BNB Chain and Ethereum as an example of EVM chains. The same process can be applied to any other EVM chains we deploy in the future.
{% endhint %}

### **Bridge CAKE from BNB Chain to Ethereum**

1 - Make sure your wallet supports both BNB Chain and Ethereum. We recommend using MetaMask.

Then open the [PancakeSwap Bridge](https://bridge.pancakeswap.finance/) and navigate to the “CAKE” section.



2 - First, let’s connect your wallet to the bridge.

Click "Connect" and choose your preferred wallet under the "EVM" section. Then confirm and approve in your wallet popup. (As of writing, only CoinBase, MetaMask or MetaMask-compatible wallets are supported. Support for more wallets is coming soon)

If you do not need to bridge CAKE to Aptos, you don’t need to connect your wallet under “Aptos” section.

3 - Close the wallet connection modal. And click the "v" in the upper token selection field and choose "BNB Chain - CAKE".



4 - Click the "v" in the “Network” part of the lower token selection field and choose "Ethereum".

5 - Input the number of CAKE you want to bridge to in the upper section.



6 - **If your Ethereum address is already utilized with an ETH balance, you can turn off the “gas on destination” to save some BNB.**

Otherwise, if your Ethereum address is never utilized and has no ETH balance, we recommend keeping the "gas on destination" option at its default. Or you can choose an ETH amount you want to receive.

The bridge will deposit the set amount of ETH to your destination address to kickstart your journey on Ethereum. The corresponding amount in BNB will be charged with the market rate.



7 - Click "Transfer" to initiate the bridging transaction and confirm via the wallet confirmation pop-up.

Please note that you must approve two transactions when you try to bridge for the first time. The first transaction is to approve CAKE.



8 - Sit back and relax. It should only take a few minutes. Once the bridging is complete, CAKE will be deposited into your Ethereum address. You can track the progress by the progress bar.
