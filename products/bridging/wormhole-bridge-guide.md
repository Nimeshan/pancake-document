2. **Connect Source Chain Wallet** - The first step is to connect a wallet. When using the widget it's not important to have your wallet preset to the network you're trying to bridge from. Wormhole will automatically set the correct network for you based on the one you have chosen. For EVM chains only Metamask is supported
3. **Select Source Chain Network** - PancakeSwap currently support 4 networks with the Wormhole Bridge (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum and Base)
4. **Select Source Chain Asset** - Select the token you want to bridge.&#x20;
5. **For Steps 4,5 and 6** - Repeat steps 1,2 and 3 with the destination chain

There are three steps to the bridge process. These steps may take some time and usually require a certain amount of block confirmations on the source chain transaction. Once this confirmation threshold is reached. Wormhole will generate proof confirming that the transaction was successful. This proof is needed in order to be able to claim your bridged asset on the destination chain.

8. Once verification is complete, you'll be able to claim your bridged assets by clicking the claim button shown:&#x20;
