{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Check for an ongoing campaign <a href="#id-978733be-1ca0-4eb6-a35e-44b7f8365222" id="id-978733be-1ca0-4eb6-a35e-44b7f8365222"></a>

## Check if your address is eligible <a href="#ced8a6c5-803a-4a60-80d0-44e823571d84" id="ced8a6c5-803a-4a60-80d0-44e823571d84"></a>

To participate in a trading reward campaign. Your address must meet the following requirements:

* Must have an active Pancake Profile
* Must have an active CAKE staking position
* The number of veCAKE balance at snapshot time is higher than the required threshold (check [here](../faq.md#cake-stakers-campaign) for more info about "veCAKE balance at snapshot time")

The easiest way to check if your address is eligible is to visit the [Trading Reward page](https://pancakeswap.finance/trading-reward) and connect your wallet. The page will guide you through the process to make your address eligible to earn CAKE from trades.

For example, you will be presented with the above screen if you do not have an active veCAKE staking position, or your veCAKE balance at snapshot time is 0. Simply follow the guide to start locking CAKE.

But please note that veCAKE is decreasing with time, therefore in order to ensure the amount of veCAKE at snapshot time meets the threshold, please follow the guidance with the preview of the snapshot amount.&#x20;

While a campaign is active, you can start locking CAKE and join the campaign at any time. Trading rewards will be counted from the beginning of the campaign; how good is that?
