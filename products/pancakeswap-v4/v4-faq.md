# v4 FAQ

**Q1 How will PancakeSwap v4 benefit traders and liquidity providers?**

**Ans:** PancakeSwap v4 brings a lot of advantages for both traders and liquidity providers:

**1. Streamlined Operations and Gas Savings:** Through features like Singleton and Flash Accounting, PancakeSwap v4 drastically reduces gas fees. Singleton consolidates all pools into a single contract, slashing deployment costs by 99%. Flash Accounting optimizes accounting processes by computing net balances for transactions, minimizing gas consumption.

**2. Direct Benefits from Advanced Features:** The integration of hooks allows for implementing dynamic fees, custom order types, and active liquidity management modules. Liquidity providers can enjoy mitigated impermanent loss (IL), MEV protection, and access to various fee tiers, ensuring more profitable and secure trading experiences.

\
**3. Flexibility in AMM Designs:** PancakeSwap v4 supports multiple pool types, including CLAMM and the LBAMM, allowing traders and LP to pick different pool types. This inclusive approach also allows supporting any future assets requiring new pricing curves.

\
**Q10** What is the licensing mechanism for PancakeSwap v4?

**Ans:** PancakeSwap v4 is committed to open-source principles. Our code will be released under an open-source license, empowering developers to innovate freely. However, As a part of our [Affiliate initiative](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/discussion-on-pancakeswap-affiliates-a-multichain-expansion-strategy/395), DeFi protocols forking PancakeSwap will be warmly welcomed and officially recognized by the Kitchen.\
\
**Q11** How does PancakeSwap v4 reduce gas fees?

**Ans:** PancakeSwap v4 leverages the Singleton and Flash accounting mechanisms to reduce gas fees significantly. By consolidating all pools into a single contract (singleton), multi-pool transactions are simplified, making them more cost-effective. Flash Accounting replaces individual transfers with net balances, computed collectively at the end of each transaction, resulting in substantial gas savings. ERC-6909 further reduces gas for frequent users by letting users keep their funds within the protocol and use them when required, eliminating transfers to/from their wallets.\
\
**Q12** Can I still use PancakeSwap during the v4 transition?

**Ans:** Yes, PancakeSwap will remain accessible during the v4 transition, with no changes to user experience.\
\
**Q13** What are Hooks in PancakeSwap v4, and how do they enable innovation on PancakeSwap v4?

**Ans:** Hooks are customizable add-ons that enhance liquidity pool functionality, allowing developers to introduce custom features and fee management options. Deployed externally, Hooks can execute predefined logic during key pool actions, offering endless possibilities, including dynamic fees, order types, custom oracles, and active liquidity management strategies.

\
**Q17** Where can we find the hook template repository?

**Ans:** Hooks template can be found at [https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks-template](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks-template) and example hooks at [https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks)\
\
**Q18** Can you explain the life cycles of hooks and their examples?

**Ans:** Hooks can be implemented before / after 5 key actions namely initialize, swap, addLiquidity, removeLiquidity, donate. For instance, when a user initiates a swap, the PoolManager contract checks if a beforeSwap hook callback exists. If it does, the logic under the beforeSwap method in the hook contract is executed; otherwise, the swap proceeds as usual. After the swap is completed, the same process occurs for the afterSwap callback.\
\
**Q19:** Do we need to perform address mining to ensure hooks are deployed at a specific address?\
**Ans:** Hooks can be deployed on any address like other contracts. Callback permissions are set at PoolKey. For more info, please see the faq for hooks here [https://developer.pancakeswap.finance/contracts/v4/overview/custom-layer-hook#faqs](https://developer.pancakeswap.finance/contracts/v4/overview/custom-layer-hook#faqs)\
\
**Q20:** How can we verify a hook contract on etherscan?&#x20;

**Ans:** If you are using foundry, you can refer to the foundry guide here [https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract) \
Or if you are using hardhat, refer to the hard guide here [https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying)\
\
**Q21:** Should we use foundry or hardhat for hook development?

**Ans:** The template [https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks-template](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-hooks-template) is based on foundry; thus, we advise using foundry. Besides that, the foundry has been growing in popularity!&#x20;

**Q22:** What are pool keys?&#x20;

**Ans:** PoolKey is a struct that describes each pool. See more here [https://developer.pancakeswap.finance/contracts/v4/overview/amm-layer-poolmanager#poolkey--poolid](https://developer.pancakeswap.finance/contracts/v4/overview/amm-layer-poolmanager#poolkey--poolid)\
