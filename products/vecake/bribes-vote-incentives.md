# Bribes (Vote Incentives)

Apart from earning CAKE via our weekly [CAKE reward pools](earn-cake-weekly/),  veCAKE holders can vote for gauges to claim bribes from external bribe marketplaces. These bribes are usually submitted by external project teams on some of our [veCAKE Managers](vecake-managers.md).&#x20;

This serves as an additional source of yield for veCAKE holders, and also diversifies the type of tokens they receive as yield.

There are two types of bribe marketplaces:&#x20;

1. Primary bribe marketplaces allow projects to submit bribes to reward **veCAKE holders** for voting for their desired gauges.
2. Secondary bribe marketplaces allow projects to submit bribes to reward a **derivative project's token holders** (e.g vlCKP from Cakepie) for voting for their desired gauges. The protocol in question (e.g. Cakepie) will then vote for the gauges with their own veCAKE holdings, based on the vote outcome of their token holders.

We currently have two primary bribe marketplaces where veCAKE holders can vote for gauges and claim bribes from external teams:

1. [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/pancakeswap)
2. [Votemarket (by StakeDAO)](https://votemarket.stakedao.org/?market=cake\&solution=All)

veCAKE holders should visit these bribe marketplaces regularly and vote for gauges that can help optimize their yield on veCAKE.
