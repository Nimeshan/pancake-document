## **What is veCAKE?**

veCAKE stands for vote-escrowed CAKE. It is not transferable, and the only way to acquire veCAKE is by staking CAKE. The maximum lock time is 4 years; the longer you lock your CAKE, the more veCAKE you’ll receive.

## **What is the purpose of veCAKE?**

veCAKE tokens serve a crucial role in PancakeSwap's governance, enabling you to actively participate in PancakeSwap’s [governance proposals ](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting)and Gauges Voting system. This allows you to vote on broader governance proposals and influence the allocation of CAKE emissions within liquidity pools.

## **What are the benefits of holding veCAKE?**
