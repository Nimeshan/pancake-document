Just like the fixed-term CAKE staking pool, to enjoy the benefits from veCAKE, simply lock CAKE for a period of time.

## Go to the CAKE staking page <a href="#dcf081d0-9b78-4bfc-be0f-44d3d227b4d2" id="dcf081d0-9b78-4bfc-be0f-44d3d227b4d2"></a>

Navigate to [https://pancakeswap.finance/cake-staking?chain=bsc](https://pancakeswap.finance/cake-staking?chain=bsc) and connect your wallet. Please note that veCAKE staking is only available on BNB Chain.
