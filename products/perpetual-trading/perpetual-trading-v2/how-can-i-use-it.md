5. Take Profit/Stop Loss & Slippage

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Perp6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Users can set a take profit or stop loss price when opening a position.

* Take Profit: Users' position will be liquidated once they reach the set upon P\&L percentage gain.
* Stop Loss: Users' position will be liquidated once they reach the set upon P\&L percentage loss.
* Slippage: Used to cancel a market order automatically if the price moved too fast in the direction of the trade before it was opened. For example if you wish to market long the current price but before your trade is opened the price moved up 1%, it will cancel automatically.

Note: You can hover over each option for more information. Please refer to [Perpetuals V2 Glossary](perpetuals-glossary.md) for an in-depth guide.
