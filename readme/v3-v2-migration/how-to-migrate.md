<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In April 2023, PancakeSwap announced V3 for Exchange and Farms. Some farming pairs will need to be migrated to keep earning staking rewards. Relax, like last time, it should be smooth.

### But wait! Do I need to migrate? <a href="#id-4b9e0260-9dee-493b-b0ad-6bdba084cea6" id="id-4b9e0260-9dee-493b-b0ad-6bdba084cea6"></a>

You need to migrate if you meet the following conditions:

**Farming on the following V2 PancakeSwap Farms:**

* BNB Chain:
  * CAKE-BNB
  * CAKE-BUSD
  * CAKE-USDT
  * BUSD-BNB
  * USDT-BNB
  * BTCB-BUSD
  * BTCB-USDT
  * BTCB-ETH
  * BTCB-BNB
  * ETH-BNB
  * ETH-USDC
  * USDC-USDT
  * BUSD-USDC
  * BUSD-USDT
* Ethereum:
  * ETH-USDC
  * ETH-USDT
  * WBTC-ETH

The list will likely grow eventually. The easiest way to check the updated list is to visit [https://pancakeswap.finance/migration](https://pancakeswap.finance/migration) and connect your wallet

**Providing V2 liquidity, and meeting the following conditions:**

* The majority of the liquidity for the token pair has been migrated to V3 - Please check the PancakeSwap Info page, or the website or social channels of the token project for more detail.
* The project team of that token has announced the liquidity will be migrated to V3 - Please check the individual project websites or social channels for more detail.

Look for the V3 migration banner on the Liquidity or Farm page. Then click “Proceed” to enter the migration helper page.



**Step 1 - Unstake from V2 and/or StableSwap farms**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In step 1, the helper will list all the PancakeSwap V2 or StableSwap farms that require migrations.

Click each of the “Unstake All” buttons to unstake all staked LP tokens from farms. Your wallet will ask for confirmation.

When all the listed farms are unstaked, click “Next Steps” to proceed.



**Step 2 - Remove liquidity from Exchange V2 or StableSwap**

In step 2, the helper will list all the liquidity positions that can be migrated to V3 with CAKE yield farming.

Click each of the "Remove" buttons to bring up the remove liquidity modal with 100% selected.&#x20;

Then click “Enable”, sign the transaction in your wallet, and click “Remove”. Your wallet will ask for confirmation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Even though some other project tokens are also migrating to V3, they will not appear in the list. Please check the individual project websites or social channels for more detail. And use the [Liquidity](https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity) page to migrate manually.
{% endhint %}



**Step 3 - Get ready for V3**

No action is needed. Simply read and make sure you are familiar with how V3 works and how to provide liquidity in V3.



**Step 4 - Add V3 liquidity**

In this step, you will add your liquidity to the new Exchange V3.

Click “Add Liquidity”. Your previously removed V2 liquidity will show up in the list, click “Add” to bring up the interface for adding V3 liquidity.

If you don’t see the pair you want to add, click “Add Other Pairs” instead and choose the two tokens manually.

{% endhint %}



**Step 5 - Stake in V3 farms**
