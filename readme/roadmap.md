# Roadmap

![](../.gitbook/assets/roadmap-header.png)

_Updated on April 5, 2024_

### Finally, it's a roadmap not a to-do list.

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.

Pivoting is a way of life.

That means that we don’t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.
